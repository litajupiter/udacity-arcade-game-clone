===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Functionality
=============

This version of the Udacity Classic Arcade Game Clone of Frogger is by Brianne Williams (n√©e Hennel). Reference sources include: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), W3Schools, YouTube (Ben Cunningham, Udacity), and the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Support Facebook Group.

To run the game, open index.html in your web browser.

The object of the game is to get your character to the river without colliding with any of the bugs. Each player starts with three lives and loses one life when a collision with a bug happens. If a player loses all three of their lives without getting to the river, they lose the game. If a player does reach the river, they are returned to the starting point and can continue to play until they lose their remaining lives.
